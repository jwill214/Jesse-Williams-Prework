# Jesse-Williams-Prework

This Repository is the collection of that work that I have completeted for the Genesis10 software developer training program's  Pre-work course. It is my hope that the work in this repository will serve as evidence of my willing-ness to learn the material featured in the program. Furthermore, it is my hope that this repository will demonstrate:

1.) my ability to study indepently. 

2.) Areas of software programming where the guidance of an instructor would benefit me most. 




in Module2_Assessment, I have placed another README.md file with instructions on how the game works.

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my work. Any constructive feedback is very much welcomed. 

peace, 

-Jesse D. Williams Jr.
