     <div class="col-9" id="p1"> Hi, My name is Jesse D. Williams Jr. I grew up in Chicago, Illinois on the Southside of town. I graduated from Simeon Career Academy High School where I majored in Culinary Arts. You may recognize Simeon as the Alma Mater of Derrick Rose and Jabari Parker. Go Wolverines! After Graduating from Simeon, I went on to Illinois State University where I majored in Mathematics. I had no clue that I'd find such success as a math major, so it was actually a big surprise to me that I completed the degree with honors. I then went on to complete a Master's in Bioinformatics Sciences from the University of Illinois at Chicago. To this day, I find that Master's degree to be the greatest test of endurance that I have ever faced in my life. But I did it! And I'm very proud of that! I also have a passion for teaching. I have taught at 6 different high schools and 2 different universities over the years and have enjoyed every bit of it.</div>

   <div class="row" style="margin-top:15px;" id="p2">
      <div class="col-12"> Outside of Academics, I consider myself to be a very family-oriented and goal-oriented person. The two things I enjoy most is time with loved ones and checking a task off of my "To-do" list. Currently on my "To-Do" list is to become a software engineer. I'd say, with the Software Engineer Development program at Genesis10, I'd be well on my way towards checking that off of my list.  </div>
   </div>

   <div class="row" id="p3">
       <div class="col-12" style="margin-top:15px;"> A random fun fact about myself is that from a young age, I practiced tumbling. I was a member of the Jesse White's Tumblers and was once a member of the gamma phi circus. My act was tumbling and vaulting. I had a lot of fun doing so and one day hope to open a tumbling gym. </div>
