The game that I have created has a Naruto theme. I was able to successfully apply an EventListener to the START of each round and so at the start of each round,the game page notifies the player of 1.) the words that They have successfully guessed, 2.) the number of wins they currently have 3.) the instructions for starting the next round and 4.) the image of the character whose name the player has succesfully guessed.

I was unable to get the EventListener to apply after EACH keystroke so you'll notice that within each round, I used prompts and alerts to notify the player of 1.) the letters that they've guessed correctly, 2.) the letters that they've guessed incorrectly, and 3.) the number of incorrect guesses that they have remaining before they've officially lost the game. I realize that this isn't the layout demonstrated to us in the description of the project and I very much welcome feedback on how I could have completed the project to the specifications shown in the demonstration. 

The soultions to the game are as follows:

round 1: kakashi

round 2: jariya

round 3: jinchuriki
